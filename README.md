# Sharpend's VFX Scripts

## Overview
Welcome!
This is a repo for the Python Scripts I made for FL Studio's VFX Script Plugin.

## Quick Start
For Quick musical use in FL Studio, go to Presets/VFX_Script and download the .fst files there.<br>
Double click on the .fst file or drag it into FL Studio inside Patcher (Generator) to load.<br>
Connect the MIDI Output (Green Dot) from the script to your favorite generator and start playing!

For Coding purposes - you can access the python code directly from Python_Scripts/ dir.

You can watch a breakdown of what these scripts can do on my youtube: https://youtu.be/GXzUiVu9CAM

## KeyMod
KeyMod is meant to save you the menu diving of MIDI keyboards for all your velocity & pitch needs.<br>
This script offers a quick & easy way to modify performance of sequenced notes & live playing:<br>
Pitch transpose by semitones & octaves<br>
Velocity modifiers:<br>
base offset, multiplier, min & max thresholds & randomize velocity<br>

## Harmonizer
Harmonizer is a modular harmony voice generator, here to introduce simple & randomly generated harmony to your MIDI.<br>
It can Generate additional velocity modified harmony voices, that are quantized to scale.<br>
These voices can be a set interval, or be randomly chosen from 2 different randomization modes.<br>
