# Sharpend's VFX Scripts

## Overview
Welcome!
This is a repo for the Python Scripts I made for FL Studio's VFX Script Plugin.

## Quick Start
For Quick musical use in FL Studio, go to Presets/VFX_Script and download the .fst files there.<br>
Double click on the .fst file or drag it into FL Studio inside Patcher (Generator) to load.<br>
Connect the MIDI Output (Green Dot) from the script to your favorite generator and start playing!

For Coding purposes - you can access the python code directly from Python_Scripts/ dir.
